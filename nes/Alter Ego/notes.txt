Possible challenges:
- Clearing levels under a specific time (could use music clock maybe?)
- Clearing stages or groups of stages with extra swaps remaining
- Clearing stages with the least amount of player movement. (could be impossible)
- Arriving at unusual places on certain stages
- Walking under all the skulls in Midnight
- Breaking all the platforms on certain stages
- Clear the game twice in a row (maybe)
- Jump off the 5 ledges in Promenade safely
