- Meme cheevo "all your base are belong to us" for watching intro scene with the best japanese to english translation of the history of videogames.

- Pass through stage X without dying (stage select trick allowed)
Not sure if it's fair to make these cheevos for hard only. Will check it.

- Upgrade each weapon from level 1 to 3 without getting any other weapon
In this game if you change the weapon the level of the previous weapon is kept. So a cheevo for upgrading from 1 to 3 without changing can be interesting.

- Get the level 4 power up
It's a bit tricky to power up your weapon to level 4, so it deserves a cheevo. But as it's a rare situtation on the game, I think that getting the level 4 regardless the weapon is enough (I mean, no need for making 3 cheevos for getting each weapon on level 4).

- Cat Zig: collect 9 lives.

- A score based cheevo
Will check what score should be considered high (and fair) enough for a cheevo.
